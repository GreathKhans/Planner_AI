# Planner_AI
This project proposes an intelligent system that parses daily notes and action logs, automatically identifies tasks, and schedules them into the user’s calendar. The AI will extract, classify, and prioritize tasks from freeform text, then place each task in appropriate calendar slots based on user-defined routines
